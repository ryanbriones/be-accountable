# Be Accountable

A Seinfeld "don't break the chain" with public flogging of your failures on social networks

## What is there

When a Responsibility has been recorded, Be Accountable is enable to check that there is an Entry for that Responsibility for that date and every future date. When a date has an Entry for every Responsibility, it's considered complete, like a strike in bowling. Dates with Entries for only some of it's Responsibilities are considered partially complete, like a spare in bowling. Dates with no Entries for it's Responsibilities are considered don't have a special meaning yet, but should be considered a gutter. There is a UI for checking whether there are Responsibilities and if they are complete.

## TODO

* UI for Responsibilities and Entries
* Allow Responsibilities to have "temporal patterns" like "every week"
* Twitter OAuth and Facebook Connect integration for being social. Maybe both public flogging AND updates for reaching goals too, like a gowalla check-in, asking the user's permission of course.
* Add User so that Be Accountable can become a multi-user site/service
* Strike, Spare and Gutter icons that are not stolen from http://github.com/entp/seinfeld
